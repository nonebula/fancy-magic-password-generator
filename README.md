# fancy-magic-password-generator
The fanciest magic password generator and only one you'll ever need! Generating up to 128 characters in a unique combination! Use the prompt generator triggered by the 'generate password' button to get started.

## Description 
The goal of this project was to deliver a password generator that met specific criteria including use of prompts and JavaScript functions. Several arrays were provided that I used to generate the password characters based on the user's needs. 

Due to the nature of this project, there was no creation of html or css elements and I did not format the html page in any way other than was provided as a starter template.

## Credits

The project was completed independently but built off the source code from: edX Boot Camps LLC. I worked with a friend, Sam Millar, to explore the fundamentals of Javascript and clarify my work. I also worked through the modules on Codecademy to better develop my understanding to enable me to solve these challenges. In producing this webpage, I also utilized a range of tutorials from W3 Schools and referred to multiple posts on Stack Overflow.
